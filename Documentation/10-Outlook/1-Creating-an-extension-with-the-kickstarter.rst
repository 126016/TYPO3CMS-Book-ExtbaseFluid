Creating an Extension With the Extension Builder
================================================

When creating an extension you have to write quite a bit of recurrent
code. Usually, getter and setter methods are required for every
property of the domain model. Additionally, corresponding entries
in the TCA definition and in the SQL table definition are
necessary. Setting up these things by hand can be very exhausting.

The Extension Builder reduces this effort.
You can create the model of your extension with a graphical user interface.
The correct domain models, the TCA definition, SQL files, etc. will be automatically created.
