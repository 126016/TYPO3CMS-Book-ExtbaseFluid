Target Audience
==============================

This book is for TYPO3 extension developers who have basic knowledge
in PHP programming and in working with and administering TYPO3. It gives a
compact introduction into the Extbase framework and the Fluid template
engine. We are striving for the following target audiences:

* Beginners, who want to use Extbase and Fluid right from start as a
  basis for own extensions
* Experienced developers, who want to learn Extbase and Fluid before
  a new project
* Developers, who want to port their existing extensions early to FLOW3
* Deciders, who want to gain a technical overview over the new framework.
