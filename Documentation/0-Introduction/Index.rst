Introduction
============

Extbase is a PHP-based framework which supports developers in creating clean and easily
maintainable TYPO3 extensions. The template engine Fluid makes sure that the user interface
of the extension can easily be created individually.

Extbase ensures a clear separation between different concerns, which makes maintenance a lot
more simple thanks to modular code. Because of this modular design, the development time
and associated costs are reduced for initial development and for adjustments. Extbase
also lessens the burden on the developer when it comes to security-relevant and repetitive tasks:
for example the validation of arguments, the persistence of data, and access to TypoScript and
FlexForm settings. Developers can therefore focus on solving the problems of their clients much more efficiently.

Because of the modern architecture and the usage of up-to-date software
development paradigms, using Extbase needs different knowledge than before.
Instead of "hacking together" an extension, programmers now must understand
some concepts like Domain-Driven Design, whilst planning and modeling the extension
more thoroughly before implementation. In return, the source code
of the extension becomes a lot more readable, more flexible and more
extensible. Moreover, the concepts are also applicable within other
programming languages and frameworks, as development paradigms like
Domain-Driven Design or Model-View-Controller architecture can be used
universally.
