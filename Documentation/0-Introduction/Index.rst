Introduction
============

**Extbase** is a PHP-based framework for TYPO3. The templating engine **Fluid** makes sure that the user interface
of the extension can be created easily and separately from the functionality (MVC).

Extbase ensures a clear separation between different concerns which simplifies maintenance.
The modular design reduces the development time and associated costs for initial development
and for adjustments. Extbase
also lessens the burden on the developer when it comes to security-related and repetitive tasks like
the validation of arguments, the persistence of data, and access to TypoScript and
FlexForm settings. Developers can therefore focus on solving the problems of their
clients much more efficiently.

Because of the modern architecture and the usage of up-to-date software
development paradigms, using Extbase requires specific knowledge.
Extension programmers must understand
some concepts like Domain-Driven Design, whilst planning and modeling the extension
more thoroughly before implementation. This has the advantage that the source code
of the extension becomes better readable, more flexible and
extensible.
