=============
Install TYPO3
=============

The installation guide contains installation instructions:
:ref:`t3install:quick-installation`.

You will need a web server like Apache with PHP and a database. See
:ref:`t3install:system-requirements` in the "Installation and Upgrade Guide".

If you do not have a system available, that meets these requirements, there
are several alternatives:

* You can use the **XAMPP** package (http://www.apachefriends.org/xampp.html). It
  will install Apache, PHP, MySQL and other useful tools on all established
  operating systems (Linux, Windows, Mac OS X).
* You can **setup TYPO3 with DDEV**, which provides several pre-configured environments
  based on Docker, including TYPO3. :ref:`t3contrib:ddev` in the contribution
  guide contains some information about how to setup TYPO3 with DDEV, but
  instead of `git clone` in the first
  step, you should download a release from https://get.typo3.org.
