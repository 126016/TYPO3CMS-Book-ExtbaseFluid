Configuring the Server
======================

You will need a web server like Apache with PHP and a database. See
:ref:`t3install:system-requirements` in the "Installation an Upgrade Guide".

If you don't have a local development server yet, we recommend the XAMPP
package (http://www.apachefriends.org/xampp.html). It
will install Apache, PHP, MySQL and other useful tools on all established
operating systems (Linux, Windows, Mac OS X). 

Now, proceed to install TYPO3 on your development system: :ref:`t3install:quick-installation`.
