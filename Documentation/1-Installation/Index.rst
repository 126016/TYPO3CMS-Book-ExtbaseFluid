In this chapter we want to help you to set up an efficient working
environment. There are some notes how to set up the development server to
start with. After that there will be an explanation how to install the two
TYPO3 extensions *extbase* and *fluid* which this book is about. Furthermore we
will give you some recommendations how set up your development environment
(IDE), to have code completion and the IDE integrated Debugger right at your
hand. A list of some more TYPO3 Extensions that might be helpful to you,
will round up this chapter - including information from which sources to get
them.

.. tip::

   We assume that you already have some knowledge how to set up a TYPO3
   environment and therefore we will concentrate on the installation of Extbase
   and Fluid and their related components. See :ref:`t3install:start` for
   information about creating a working TYPO3 installation.
